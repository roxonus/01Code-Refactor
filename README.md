# 01code-refactor
1st homework assignment

The first work I did was to add indentation and spacing to the html file, in a way that made the code flow well and made it easy to read. 

Once the html had a consice flow, I added the images to the proper spots so that they appear on the website.

I then switched the div tag in line eleven for the header tag.
I switched the div tag in line thirteen for a nav tag.
I switched the div tag in line thirty three for an article tag.
I switched the div tags in lines thirty five, fourty five and fifty five for article tags.
I switched the div tag in line sixty seven for an aside tag.
I switched the div tags in lines sixty eight, seventy seven, and eighty six for article tags.
I switched the div tag in line ninety eight for a footer tag.
I switched the div tag in line ninety nine for a span tag.
